# Berry Hunt 2025

During 2025 April 20th - 26th, the latest patch of Monika's D-Sides was part of v4.77, the "Berry Hunt 2025" version. This acted as a limited-time event that added one or two berries to each checkpoint in all main pack levels and most checkpoints in museum levels.

This directory holds TAS files that 100% each level on v4.77, which includes getting these extra berries. No other directories in this repository are designed for v4.77, so files in this directory should not read from files outside of it (except for things like overworld menuing that are extremely unlikely to be changed by D-Sides updates).

The latest Berry Hunt 2025 patch was v4.77.3, which Monika has archived [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/download/150759#FileInfo_1427464). Older v4.77 versions have no known gameplay differences, with one exception: in 6Dark room `center-01h`, v4.77.1 is missing a breakable wall, which will desync the TAS when exiting the room due to a lack of freeze frames.
